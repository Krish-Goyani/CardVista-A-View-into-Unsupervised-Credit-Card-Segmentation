# CardVista: A View into Unsupervised Credit Card Segmentation

CardVista is a data-driven solution developed for Goyani Bank, a leading financial institution. The project aims to provide personalized services and targeted marketing campaigns to the bank's diverse customer base by leveraging customer segmentation and predictive modeling techniques.

## Project Overview

Goyani Bank, a leading financial institution, faced the challenge of providing personalized services and targeted marketing campaigns to its diverse customer base. With a vast portfolio of credit card customers, it became difficult to understand their varying preferences and behavior patterns. This problem hindered the bank's ability to enhance customer satisfaction, retention, and ultimately, drive growth.


## Key Features

1. **Customer Segmentation**: Using unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as clustering algorithms, CardVista groups customers with similar characteristics and behaviors into distinct segments. This provides valuable insights into different customer personas and their financial behaviors.

2. **Predictive Modeling**: After identifying customer segments, CardVista trains a predictive model on the clustered data. This model can accurately classify new customers into the appropriate segments, enabling the bank to tailor its product offerings, marketing strategies, and customer service initiatives accordingly.

3. **Model Evaluation and Optimization**: CardVista evaluates the performance of the predictive model and optimizes it through techniques like feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, or ensemble methods to improve accuracy and robustness.



## Approach

The project followed a structured approach:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Conducted an in-depth exploration of the customer credit card data, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and necessary transformations.
2. **Unsupervised Learning for Customer Segmentation**: Leveraged unsupervised machine learning techniques to group customers based on relevant features, identifying distinct customer segments.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Trained a predictive model on the clustered data to classify new customers into appropriate segments.
4. **Model Evaluation and Optimization**: Evaluated and optimized the predictive model's performance using various techniques.
